pymonnit
========
Python ORM client library for interfacing to the imonnit service.

Still very early stage but basic ORM and XML parsing is complete. It is loosely based on the Django/Mongoengine ORM but borrowing the patterns from SQLAlchemy for explicit gateway type API interactions for querying.
